YourBook is a SE's exam project that aims to create a website for books recommendation. 
Its goal is to let the user insert books already read and the website -using a AI module (not added)- suggests a list of books which the user may like, based on the genre or the author of the book.
It is still in a very primitive state, but the part of registration, login and book insertion is already working properly.

Authors are: P. Petta, S. D'Urso, R. Amaro
